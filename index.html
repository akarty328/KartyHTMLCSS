      <h3>Forst Fires</h3>
      <p>A forest fire or wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns out large areas of land. On average, more than 100,000 wildfires, clear 4 million to 5 million acres of land in the U.S. every year. A wildfire moves at speeds of up to 14 miles an hour
        consuming everything in its path.</p>

      <h3>Prevention</h3>
      <p>Firefighters fight wildfires by depriving them of one or more of the fire fundamentals. Traditional methods include water dousing and spraying fire retardants to extinguish existing fires. Clearing vegetation to create firebreaks starves a fire
        of fuel and can help slow or contain it. Firefighters also fight wildfires by deliberately starting fires in a process called controlled burning. These prescribed fires remove undergrowth, brush, and ground litter from a forest, depriving a wildfire
        of fuel.</p>

      <h3>How to Prepare</h3>
      <blockquote cite="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2007/oct/22/quotes-about-the-southern-california-wildfires/">
        <p><i>"It's very important that (residents) understand that life is more
           important than property. If they're asked to leave they must leave.
           When they don't leave they not only threaten their lives but they take
          firefighters and law enforcement away from what they're doing to get them
           out of the house."</i> <br />--San Diego County Sheriff Bill Kolender</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Residents who live in frequent high wildfire risk areas should prepare your family and home before a wildfire happens.
        <ol>
          <li>Maintain a 30 foot burn free area around your home</li>
          <li>Regulary clean the roof and gutters</li>
          <li>Have a wildfire emergency plan and have a prepared emergency kit</li>
          <li>Stay tuned to local and regional alerts</li>
