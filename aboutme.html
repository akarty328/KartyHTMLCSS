      <h1>Adam Karty</h1>
      <p> Hello everyone, my name is Adam Karty and I'm begining my coding
        adventure here at Grand Circus! I'm almost twenty three and have lived in Michigan
        almost my whole life. I am very excited to start a new career
        and am looking forward to the next couple months.</p>
